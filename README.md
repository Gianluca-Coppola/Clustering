# Air Quality Clustering Analysis

A machine learning project that applies K-Means clustering to analyze air quality sensor data, using dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques to identify patterns in environmental measurements.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses the **Air Quality UCI dataset**, which contains:
- **9,358 hourly averaged responses** from chemical sensors
- **8 sensor features**: CO, NMHC, NOx, NO2, O3, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Absolute Humidity
- Data collected from March 2004 to February 2005

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gianluca-Coppola/Clustering.git
cd Clustering
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
